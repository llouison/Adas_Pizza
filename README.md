# HOMEWORK: 🍕 Ada's Pizza Express..... VERSION 2.0!!!!!! 🍕

Ada really loves the pizza website you made her last night. However! Her pizza business has been growing and now she needs a PSQL database hooked up to it. 

### You'll be following the example provided by `final-adaquotes-mvc` from the lecture today [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/nyc-wdi-ada/LECTURE_U02_D09_ExpressMVC/tree/master/final-adaquotes-mvc), and [the step by step in the lecture markdown today](https://git.generalassemb.ly/nyc-wdi-ada/LECTURE_U02_D09_ExpressMVC/).

The lecture notes are **very thorough**. 🚨 Once again, ***DO NOT COPY AND PASTE!!!*** 🚨 The more times you type something, the better you'll understand it. This is _proven science_.

## 🍕 What's been provided for you:

- A solution for last night's pizza homework, including routes and views 🙌 **NOTE**! If you're super proud of your views, feel free to use those instead of the ones here!!!
- A pizza database seed file and migration.

## 🍕 Before you start:

- **Read through** the [lecture notes from today](https://git.generalassemb.ly/nyc-wdi-ada/LECTURE_U02_D09_ExpressMVC/) again.
- **Read through** the entire code for the express app so far.
- **Create a `pizza_development` database.** [Follow the instructions here.](https://git.generalassemb.ly/nyc-wdi-ada/LECTURE_U02_D09_ExpressMVC/#part-1-lets-set-up-our-database) **NOTE**: You will be following the instructions from the lecture markdown for this full homework. I am just mentioning this step in particular because your database **MUST BE NAMED** `pizza_development` in order for the migrations and seeds to work properly.

## 🚀 Completion looks like:

- You have a working pizza app with a database.
- Your pizza app has a controller and a model.
- You have styled your pizza app.
- **You have chronicled every error you encountered in your errors.md markdown file,** along with the steps you think you may need to fix it.



## 🚀 Your homework submission should include:

- An issue ticket created on the repo `ada-students` [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/nyc-wdi-ada/ada-students/issues/new)
- A link to your fork of this repository
- A link to your `errors.md` file
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.

## This homework is due 🚨 11PM ON FRIDAY NIGHT 🚨

## Good luck, pizza warriors!! 💪💪
